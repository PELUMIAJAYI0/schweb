        <h2>Punishment</h2>
        <p>
            Prefects have the authority to administer mild punishments to students who arrive late or cause disturbances in the school. Additionally, they may be assigned the responsibility of supervising punishments given by class teachers, section coordinators, or the Vice Principal. These punishments can include tasks such as emptying the dust bin, picking up pieces of paper, dusting the classroom, cleaning toilets, filling wash hand bowls with water, and cutting grass around the school premises. The purpose of these responsibilities is to instill discipline and a sense of responsibility among the students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Punishments for more serious offenses, such as fighting or repeatedly skipping classes and homework, can be given by the Principal or Vice-Principal. These punishments may involve tasks like grass cutting or caning. The Principal has the authority to delegate the power to administer caning to any of the teachers, but no prefect is allowed to cane students. The aim of such punishments is to deter inappropriate behavior and foster a responsible and respectful learning environment within the school.
