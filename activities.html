    <h2>Parent Teacher Association</h2>
    <p>
      The Federal Ministry of Education recognises this Association nation wide as a forum for parents to meet on one on one basis with the teachers and the children to discuss problems of the school and how the association can assist the school.
      It is an advisory body and has no administrative power over the school. It can make rules to regulate its own proceedings as long as such rules do not conflict with the policies of the management of the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is usually a chairman elected from the parents' body and a secetary who is a staff of the school. All parents are expected to attend the meetings of the PTA especially when the issue of the levies to be contributed for carrying out projects for the school is being discussed.
